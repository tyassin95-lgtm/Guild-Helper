# Logo Image

**IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder with the actual logo image.

## Quick Start
1. Download the logo from: https://i.imgur.com/gdJFbV2.png
2. Save it as `logo.png` in this directory (replacing the current placeholder)
3. The login page will automatically display the new logo

## Current Status
- ✅ HTML updated to use `<img>` tag instead of crown emoji
- ✅ CSS updated for proper logo sizing and responsiveness  
- ⚠️ Placeholder image currently in place (needs replacement with actual logo)

## Logo Specifications
- **Format:** PNG (recommended) or SVG
- **Dimensions:** Flexible (will be scaled to fit)
- **Display Size:** 120px × 120px on desktop, 96px on tablets, 80px on mobile
- **Styling:** Includes subtle glow effect and pulse animation

## For Developers
The logo image path is configured as `/static/images/logo.png` in the codebase.

**Note:** For production deployments, consider hosting the logo in a reliable, version-controlled location rather than relying on third-party image hosting services to ensure availability.
