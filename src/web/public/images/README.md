# Logo Image

**IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder with the actual logo image.

1. Download the logo from: https://i.imgur.com/gdJFbV2.png
2. Save it as `logo.png` in this directory (replacing the current placeholder)
3. The login page will automatically display the new logo

The HTML and CSS have been configured to use `/static/images/logo.png`.

## Current Status
- ✅ HTML updated to use `<img>` tag instead of crown emoji
- ✅ CSS updated for proper logo sizing and responsiveness  
- ⚠️ Placeholder image currently in place (needs replacement with actual logo)

## For Developers
If you cannot access the imgur link, you can also:
- Place any PNG logo image here as `logo.png`
- The image will be displayed at 120px × 120px (96px on tablets, 80px on mobile)
- The logo includes a subtle glow effect and pulse animation
